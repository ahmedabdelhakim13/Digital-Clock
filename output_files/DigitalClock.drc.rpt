Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'DigitalClock.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332144): No user constrained base clocks found in the design
Info (332143): No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info (332123): Deriving Clock Uncertainty. Please refer to report_sdc in the Timing Analyzer to see clock uncertainties.
Info (308046): (Information) Rule T101: Nodes with more than the specified number of fan-outs. (Value defined:30). Found 5 node(s) with highest fan-out.
